In this project, I Will guide you to install Home Assistance on Raspberry Pi 4.
To use most smart home devices, you need to download an app, create an account, and link them to an online cloud server. This makes them easy to control, but it also means that your usage data, such as when, where, or how you operate your devices, is stored online and may not be private. If you care about privacy, you can try Home Assistant, a software that lets you manage your smart IoT devices and automate your smart home locally —without any cloud connection or integration.
Home Assistant is a free, open-source, and lightweight home automation software that runs on top of Home Assistant Operating System.

Home Assistant OS can be installed and configured on Raspberry Pi 4, which is a low-power and compact device for running Home Assistant.

Download the Home Assistant OS image for your Raspberry Pi 4 64-bit using this hyperlink.

https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system/releases/download/7.3/haos_rpi4-7.3.img.xz
Then download, install, and open the Raspberry Pi Imager tool to flash the Home Assistant OS image to an SD card.

In the Imager tool first select the downloaded OS image.

Click Storage and choose the connected Micro SD card.

Click Write and wait for the process to complete. This may take a while.

After the Home Assistant OS image is flashed successfully, eject the Micro SD card, and connect it to the Raspberry Pi’s card slot.

Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers (SBCs) developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom. The Raspberry Pi project originally leaned towards the promotion of teaching basic computer science in schools.The original model became more popular than anticipated, selling outside its target market for uses such as robotics. It is widely used in many areas, such as for weather monitoring,[19] because of its low cost, modularity, and open design. It is typically used by computer and electronic hobbyists, due to its adoption of the HDMI and USB standards.

The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B was released in June 2019  with a 1.5 GHz 64-bit quad core ARM Cortex-A72 processor, on-board 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5, full gigabit Ethernet (throughput not limited), two USB 2.0 ports, two USB 3.0 ports, 1–8 GB of RAM, and dual-monitor support via a pair of micro HDMI (HDMI Type D) ports for up to 4K resolution. The version with 1 GB RAM has been abandoned and the prices of the 2 GB version have been reduced. The 8 GB version has a revised circuit board. The Pi 4 is also powered via a USB-C port, enabling additional power to be provided to downstream peripherals, when used with an appropriate PSU.
